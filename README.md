This is a PyTorch implementation of the OFTNet network from the paper Orthographic Feature Transform for Monocular 3D Object Detection. The code currently supports training the network from scratch on the KITTI dataset - intermediate results can be visualised using Tensorboard. The current version of the code is intended primarily as a reference, and for now does not support decoding the network outputs into bounding boxes via non-maximum suppression. This will be added in a future update. Note also that there are some slight implementation differences from the original code used in the paper.
